#gitrel

A simple tool that shows in the commandline the status of your branches against remote branches etc.

I often find myself having to try and keep track of what's going on and this simplifies things

##Deps
- libgit2 (Usually will be installed on your system when you add git)

```Shell
./make_deps //This installs submodules
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```
